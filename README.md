# Global Github Settings

There are a lot of global settings and configurations that should be applied on
all repos that we have. These settings can be found here.

## Active

### todo

[todo](https://github.com/JasonEtco/todo) will automatically create an issue for
each instance of `TODO` found when code is merged into a master branch. This
phrase is case sensitve and has been changed from the default `@todo` to prevent
unnecessary issues from being created.
